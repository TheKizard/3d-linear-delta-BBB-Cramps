#DeltaForce 3D Printer#

This configuration drives a custom design linear delta 4-axis 3D printer using the PRU for
high speed step/dir pulse generation and a CRAMPS driver board.

There are currently max limit switches configured. There are two sets of ini and hal files included.
1) Uses standard axis gui.
2) Uses mkwrapper for remote machinekit client access for Machineface.
